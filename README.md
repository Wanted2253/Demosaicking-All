# Demosaicking-All
Demosaicking is a popular problem in Computer Vision.
Research has been going on for the past two decades to improve the state of the art demosaicking algorithms.
A few such algorithms are Smooth Hue Interpolation, Laplacian Corrected Interpolation,Gradient Based Threshold Free Interpolation, Residual Interpolation, Minimized Laplacian Residual Interpolation and TIPRI.
